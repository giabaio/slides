# Fun with colours & spaces

## With a subtitle

This shows how to use colours in the slides. A bunch are pre-defined in the `.css` file and can be used simply as:

- The .red[**predictive**] distribution can be computed as follows.

More can be created by simply modifying the `.css` file to add more `HEX` codes.

- For example use
   ```{css echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,prompt=FALSE}
   .uclblue {
     color: #002855;
   }
   ```
   (though this colour is already defined)

- The default is in [`assets/ucl-powerpoint.css`](assets/ucl-powerpoint.css), but can also use the [`assets/beamer.css`](assets/beamer.css) template or create new ones...

`r vspace("20px")`

Can add vertical space using the command 
```{r echo=T,eval=FALSE,prompt=FALSE}
`r vspace("XXX")`
```
where `XXX` is a suitable unit, eg `"20px"`.

# Some maths

We can also include maths, using standard $\rm\LaTeX$:

$$\class{myblue}{p(y\mid\mathcal{D}) = \int p(y\mid\bm\theta)p(\boldsymbol\theta\mid\mathcal{D})d\boldsymbol\theta} $$

To use colours with $\rm\LaTeX$, needs a little hack: `$\class{color}{expression}$`

You can define a probabilistic assumption as
.myblue[$$y \mid \bm\theta \sim \dpois(\bm\theta) $$]
but in line it would look like this $\color{MidnightBlue}{y\sim \dnorm(\mu,\sigma^2)}$ 

These use the predefined $\rm\LaTeX$ macros, saved in the file [`assets/latex_macros.html`](assets/latex_macros.html). More can be (re)defined by simply adding to the file, which gets pre-loaded at the beginning of the resulting `.html` output

`r vspace("2rem")`
For instance, the command `$\dnorm$` translates to the text Normal (typeset in the current font)

---

# Other LaTeX stuff

There's also a file [`assets/latex_colours.tex`](assets/latex_colours.tex), which can be used in LaTeX chunks, eg
```
\input{assets/latex_colours.tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
...

```

- This would be a chunk with header like this: `{r,engine='tikz', echo=F, opts=list(width="85%",title="INSERT TEXT HERE")}`

- Then all the colours and, possibly other advanced LaTeX macro defined in `assets/latex_colours.tex` are accessible by `tikz` chunks


- But also, the "extension" `"color.js"` (loaded in `assets/latex_macros.tex`) enables semi-standard LaTeX colouring

- For example `$\displaystyle \color{olive} x^2=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$` renders as
$\displaystyle \color{olive} x^2=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$, which essentially looks the same as when using `$\class{color}{math formula}$`

# Numbered lists & references
- This is a bullet list and $\class{spanish-yellow}{\theta \sim \dgamma(\alpha,\beta)}$ `r Citep(bibfile,"Baio:2012")`
   - Test 

- And another
   1. With a numbered item `r Cite(bibfile,"Baio:2019")`
   2. And another

- With more items


Can reset the counter of a list
```
<ol style="counter-reset: my-counter 9;">
  <li>Number Ten</li>
  <li>Number Eleven</li>
</ol>
```
which renders as
<ol style="counter-reset: my-counter 9;">
  <li>Number Ten</li>
  <li>Number Eleven</li>
</ol>

# A page with left & right columns

.pull-left[
Some content here

```{r echo=FALSE}
tab=tibble(
  names=c("Gianluca","Marta","Kobi","Anna"),
  sex=c("Male","Female","Male","Female")
)

# See: https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf
library(kableExtra)
tab %>% kable(bootstrap=TRUE,col.names=c("Name","Sex")) %>%  kable_styling(font_size = 28) %>% 
  column_spec(1,width="25%") %>% column_spec(2,width="65%") %>% 
  row_spec(0,extra_css="border-bottom: 1px solid") %>% 
  row_spec(nrow(tab),extra_css="border-bottom: 1px solid")
```
]

.pull-right[
Just a test to see what happens here even if the text is really long
]

# More columns

This also creates two columns, but with different split of the page width (and check the file [`assets/ucl-powerpoint.css`](assets/ucl-powerpoint.css) for other possibilities)
`r vspace("5em")`

.left-column[
Some text here
]
.right-column[
Some more text here
]

# Tries the panelsets

### [https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/panelset](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/panelset)

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r onlycode, fig.show='hide'}
# This would make a plot of 1000 random draws for a Normal(0,1) 
plot(rnorm(1000),axes=F)
axis(1);axis(2)
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Graph]
```{r ref.label="onlycode", echo=FALSE,opts=list(width="45%",title="This is just a test to see if alt text works")}
```
]
]

---

# More on graphs

- The file [`assets/setup.R`](assets/setup.R) contains a bunch of `R` commands to create functions and shortcuts that can be used with the normal `Rmd` code

- Also, it contains some extra functions and customisation to tell `knitr` how to process the `Rmd` file
   - Specifically, in order to create an ["alternative text"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute), it uses a trick
   - This essentially means that the width of any graph created by `R` is controlled by the extra "chunk" option 
   ```{r eval=FALSE}
   opts=list(...)
   ```
   
   which contains various elements
   ```{r eval=FALSE}
   opts=list(
    width="X%",
    title="SOME TEXT",
    alt="SOME TEXT",
    ...
   )
   ```
   - `title` will produce the actual "alt text", while `alt` will simply add some text to the `html` file (that can be read out for accessibility)

```{r refs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
PrintBibliography(bibfile,.opts=list(max.names=3))
