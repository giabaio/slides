\title{Create Quarto slides using a `gb` predefined template}
\usage{
quarto_slides(file_name, directory = here::here("slides"), assets = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{The file name for your .qmd file (with or without ".qmd" at
the end; the function takes care of that to avoid needing to remember
whether to include it or not!)}

\item{directory}{The directory where the files should be created.
Defaults to `here::here("slides")`. The code can handle different formats
for this string. It could be a full absolute path, eg `~/Desktop/test`, or
a relative path (eg `myslides`, which is then relative to the current
working directory). It can contain a trailing `/` or not -- if needed it
is added automatically to ensure all the relevant files can be copied
over in the right path}

\item{assets}{A logical value to instruct R to also copy over the
'assets' folder - if set to FALSE, it will not, which may be helpful
when creating a single folder with several lecture slides and thus only the
existing version of 'assets' may need to be kept in}
